                I am a deeply immersed in web technologies, and
                my coding journey began amidst the COVID lockdown in <code>2020</code>. Starting
                with <strong>Python</strong>, I later ventured into web technologies during my
                second year of college. However, it was my fascination with <strong
                    >Operating Systems</strong
                > and <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> that truly intrigued me, revealing the intricacies
                of deploying and maintaining apps at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a solid understanding of programming languages like <strong>Typescript</strong
                >, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>C++</strong>, my programming skills and
                proficiency in data structures and algorithms have helped me tackle over <code
                    >490 LeetCode problems</code
                >. This experience has provided me with diverse perspectives and refined my
                problem-solving skills.
            </p>

                started using Linux in January <code>2022</code>; Itâ€™s almost <code>3 years</code>
                into that and I enjoyed everything about Linux. I began with vim and moved to neovim,
                and my <a href="https://github.com/Lakshmanshankar/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> repository
                had grown a lot since then. I love the awesome command line tools which make my developer
                workflow a breeze to work with. And I love <strong
                    >dark color schemes with gradient texts</strong
                >; you can see them in all my works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my skills in <strong>web technologies</strong> and
                deepening my understanding of data structures. For further details, hereâ€™s a link to
